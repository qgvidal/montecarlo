# APPLYING MONTECARLO METHODS WITH PYTHON

Montecarlo simulation is a non-deterministic statistic method used to solve a high complexity maths problems through the random variable generation.

The key of this method is understanding the meaning of “simulation”. It means that by repeating and experiment quite long number of times you will be able to approximate the real behavior of a system

Where are Montecarlo methods being used?

For example, investment sector is been using this methods during a long time for solving problems like: creation, analysis a value of investment porfolios, risk model creation and also valuing complex financial product.

Also, astronomers, mathematicians and physicists are using it for solving space and projects that, otherwise, would be almost impossible to solve.
